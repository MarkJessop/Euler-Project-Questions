Description

This project was undertaken to try and motivate myself to learn some of the languages that are availible for use today.  Instead of reading tutorials, I always find the most effective way to learn a language is to actually put it to use. The Project Euler questions give a good framework for developing skills without having to come up with new projects on my own.

In order to subverse myself in as many languages as possible, I'll be doing 5 questions in one language before going back and doing those same questions in another language.  I'll be starting off with 4 languages at once and then expanding to new languages later on.
